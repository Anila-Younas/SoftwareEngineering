AntFarm Simulation Project

Project Overview

The AntFarm Simulation Project is a C++ implementation that demonstrates the application of various design patterns in software engineering. It includes creational, structural, and behavioral patterns to simulate the behavior and management of ant colonies in a meadow environment. The project fulfills academic requirements for implementing design patterns while fostering creative problem-solving skills.

Key Features

Singleton Pattern: Ensures only one Meadow instance exists throughout the simulation.

Builder Pattern: Constructs ant farms incrementally by building rooms.

Factory Pattern: Creates Drones, Warriors, and Queens in their respective contexts.

Decorator Pattern: Tracks and extends the attributes of ants dynamically.

Mediator Pattern: Manages tick-based simulation events and interactions between ants and colonies.

Templates: Implements generic ant farms capable of handling any ant type.

Functional Requirements

A single meadow capable of spawning multiple ant farms.

Each ant farm contains rooms that facilitate ant activities like spawning and resting.

Ant colonies engage in battles, and attributes transfer based on the outcomes.

Queens can take over rival colonies and merge their attributes.

Ant farms have a limited capacity for resting ants based on room availability.

The simulation ends when only one active colony or queen remains.

Simulation Commands

The command-line interface supports the following operations:

spawn X Y T: Creates a colony at coordinates X, Y of species T and assigns it an identifier.

Example: spawn 14 32 Killer

give I R A: Allocates resources R of amount A to the colony identified by I.

Example: give 1 food 50

tick [T]: Executes T tick operations or a single tick if T is unspecified.

Example: tick 10

summary I: Displays the status and statistics of the colony identified by I.

Example: summary 1

Design Patterns in Use

Singleton: Restricts Meadow to a single instance.

Builder: Constructs ant farms in a step-by-step process.

Factory: Creates ants based on type and context.

Decorator: Dynamically adds or modifies ant attributes.

Mediator: Coordinates the tick-based events of the simulation.

Templates: Provides flexibility in handling various ant types.
